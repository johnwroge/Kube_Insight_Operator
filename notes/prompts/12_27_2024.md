today i tried to start the grafana part, but need to provide more detailed info to claude. 

<!-- that was 26 -->

make manifests

make install

kubectl get crds | grep observabilitystacks

make run

//separate terminal 

kubectl apply -f config/samples/monitoring_v1alpha1_observabilitystack.yaml

# Check all created resources
kubectl get pods,statefulsets,services,configmaps -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=observability-test

# Check Prometheus specifically
kubectl get statefulset,svc -n default -l app.kubernetes.io/name=prometheus

# Check logs if Prometheus pod is running
kubectl logs -l app.kubernetes.io/name=prometheus


Let's test if we can access Prometheus. We'll need to port-forward to access the UI:
kubectl port-forward svc/monitoring-test-prometheus 9090:9090


<!-- made changes to config because prometheus isnt set up tot get metrics -->

# Stop the current operator (Ctrl+C in the terminal running make run)
make run

kubectl delete statefulset monitoring-test-prometheus
kubectl delete configmap monitoring-test-prometheus-config

in separate terminal

kubectl delete statefulset monitoring-test-prometheus
kubectl delete configmap monitoring-test-prometheus-config

kubectl apply -f config/samples/monitoring_v1alpha1_observabilitystack.yaml

updated the controller to create the config correctly

make manifests
make install
make run


... problem with yaml


Your workflow is mostly correct. Here's a slight refinement with some additional context:

```bash
# Terminal 1: Prepare CRDs and run the operator locally
make manifests  # Generate CRDs and update API types
make install    # Install CRDs into the cluster
make run        # Run the operator locally (for development)

# Terminal 2: Apply the custom resource
kubectl apply -f config/samples/monitoring_v1alpha1_observabilitystack.yaml

# Terminal 3: Port-forward Prometheus (if you want to access its web interface)
kubectl port-forward svc/monitoring-test-prometheus 9090:9090
```

A few recommendations:
1. Ensure your cluster (minikube/kind/etc.) is running before these steps
2. The `make run` command runs the operator locally, which is great for development
3. For production, you'd use `make docker-build docker-push` and then deploy the operator to the cluster

To check if everything is working:
```bash
# Check the operator logs
kubectl logs -n system deployment/controller-manager

# Check the custom resource status
kubectl get observabilitystacks

# Verify Prometheus is running
kubectl get pods | grep prometheus
```
```bash
kubectl port-forward svc/monitoring-test-prometheus 9090:9090
```


We successfully troubleshooted and verified the operation of a Kubernetes operator for managing observability stacks. We confirmed that the operator is running locally and correctly creating Prometheus resources within the Kubernetes cluster. We then investigated the Prometheus instance, verifying its ability to scrape and collect metrics, particularly from the Kubernetes API server. We observed a wide range of API server metrics being collected, including request counts for various resources, HTTP response codes, and API group activities. This demonstrates that the operator is effectively deploying a functional Prometheus setup capable of monitoring critical aspects of the Kubernetes cluster's performance and behavior.
