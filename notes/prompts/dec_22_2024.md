Ah, the domain name here is just a namespace for your API resources - it doesn't need to be a real domain you own! It's used as part of your Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) to ensure uniqueness.

You could use something like:
```bash
operator-sdk init --domain=kube-insight.dev
# or
operator-sdk init --domain=kube-observe.io
# or even
operator-sdk init --domain=example.com
```

This domain becomes part of your API group. For example, if you use `kube-insight.dev`, your Custom Resources would look like:
```yaml
apiVersion: observability.kube-insight.dev/v1alpha1
kind: ObservabilityStack
```

Think of it like a namespace or package name - it just needs to be unique within your cluster. It doesn't need to be a real registered domain.

Would you like me to show you how to:
1. Initialize the operator with a sample domain?
2. See how the domain is used in the generated code?



## seting up operator

# For MacOS with brew:
brew install operator-sdk

# For other OS, check: https://sdk.operatorframework.io/docs/installation/

operator-sdk init --domain=yourdomain.com --repo=github.com/yourusername/kube_insight_operator

operator-sdk init --domain=kube-insight.io --repo=github.com/johnwroge/kube_insight_operator
