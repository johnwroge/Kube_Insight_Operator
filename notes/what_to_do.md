To demonstrate proficiency in Kubernetes and its ecosystem, here are the key skills and areas you should focus on:

1. Core Kubernetes Concepts
- Understand and be able to demonstrate expertise in Kubernetes objects like Pods, Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps, and Secrets
- Demonstrate knowledge of cluster architecture, including control plane components and worker nodes
- Show proficiency in writing and managing Kubernetes manifests (YAML configurations)

2. Container Technologies
- Docker containerization fundamentals
- Container image creation and management
- Understanding of container registries (Docker Hub, Google Container Registry, etc.)
- Multi-stage builds and container optimization

3. Deployment and Scaling Strategies
- Create and manage Deployments
- Implement horizontal pod autoscaling
- Configure rolling updates and rollbacks
- Understand different deployment strategies (blue-green, canary)

4. Networking
- Kubernetes networking concepts
- Service types (ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer)
- Ingress controllers and resources
- Network policies
- Service mesh technologies like Istio

5. State Management and Storage
- PersistentVolumes and PersistentVolumeClaims
- Storage classes
- Stateful applications management
- Volume management strategies

6. Cluster Management and Administration
